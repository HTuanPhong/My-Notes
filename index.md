title: Welcome to my note!
---
Here is where I keep track of things I wrote, please don't take things serious. I'm not an English native speaker, the reason I choose english is because resources i have access to are in english.
I would have made this repo private if GitHub allowed me : P
## Why all this

 ### Memory

 I recently realized that I'm forgetting more and more data as I keep living, quite a commonsense, but you really don't notice until it give you an existential crisis. Anyway, in order to solve this problem to the minimum data loss, I decided to document *everything* I learn for the rest of my life.

 ### Efficiency

 I understand concepts better if I sit down and document it logically. That end up saving me times and make me feel nice.

 ### Versatility

 By archiving my notes on GitHub, I can access it anywhere with internet. I can also print the GitHub page into a clean clickable PDF to share around or print it and make a book one day.

 ### Beauty
 
 Check out [this page](testings) to see awesome graphs and typeset that software can help me achieve.

Live Love Xiao Long Bao.
